    <h1>Italian Chicken Marinade</h1>
    <img src="../images/Chicken-Marinade_8-1.webp" alt="Picture of chicken">
    <h3>This Italian dressing chicken marinade is a super simple but delicious way to add flavor before grilling.</h3>
    <p>Simple and delicious - I use half a bottle of Kraft light italian dressing and add minced garlic, cracked black pepper, italian seasoning, oregano, basil, a little white wine, 1/4 c. of olive oil, and a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go. This is great with a salad or over pasta.</p>
    <p>Make our most popular chicken today to find out what all the fuss is about! </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Salad dressing</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>Chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>  Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.  </li>
        <li>  Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.  </li>
        <li>  Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.  </li>
        <li>  Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).  </li>
    </ol>
